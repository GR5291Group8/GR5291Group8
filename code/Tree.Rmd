## prepare data and split into training and testing sets
```{r}
set.seed(123)
# 75% of the data are in training set; 25% of the data are in testing set
data_vote_avg <- read.csv("../Data/cleaned_movie_data_vote_average.csv",header = TRUE)
smp_size = floor(0.75 * nrow(data_vote_avg))
train_ind = sample(seq_len(nrow(data_vote_avg)), size = smp_size)
train = data_vote_avg[train_ind, ]
test = data_vote_avg[-train_ind, ]
```

## implement tree model
```{r}
library(rpart)
tree.model <- rpart(vote_average~., method = 'anova', data = train, 
                    control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 8, minsplit = 20, cp = 0.01))
plot(tree.model, margin = 0.05)
text(tree.model, use.n = TRUE, cex = 0.5)
tree.pred <- predict(tree.model, test)
```

## performance
```{r}
error <- mean(abs((test$vote_average-tree.pred)/test$vote_average))
error
```
